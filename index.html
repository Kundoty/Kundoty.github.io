Prydatko founded Lowiro in the United Kingdom, though many of the musicians working on Arcaea are Japanese indie or doujin composers.</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(222, 154, 222);">It was important to the developers that the game's monetization method allow players to "own" their purchased content. Players can buy "packs" of songs and play them an unlimited number of times, unlike the "stamina" model commonly used in mobile game monetization, which restricts play time</p>
